- Contributors may propose changes to:
  - Technical specifications (`TECHNICAL_SPEC.md`)
  - Client implementation (`CLIENT_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`)
  - Cryptographic protocols (`CRYPTO_PROTOCOL_SPEC.md`)
  - Governance constitution (`GOVERNANCE_CONSTITUTION.md`)
  - User specification (`USER_SPECIFICATION.md`)
  - Payload specification (`PAYLOAD_SPECIFICATION.md`)
- Proposals must be submitted through pull requests with clear documentation and rationale.
- Proposals that affect governance, council rules, or fork legitimacy must be ratified by a council of at least ten members and approved by community vote, as defined in the governance charter.
- All governance-related contributions must include threshold signatures and be logged transparently.
- Contributors must respect bandwidth efficiency, privacy rules, and technical limitations defined in the specifications.
- Appeals to rejected contributions may be made through new proposals and community votes.

This CONTRIBUTING guide ensures that all contributions remain constitutionally bound, transparent, and enforceable under the governance charter.
