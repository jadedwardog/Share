Governance Charter for Decentralized Content Platform

* Councils must consist of at least ten elected members to be considered valid.  
* Council members are elected by the community and serve a maximum of two four-year terms.  
* Councils are regionally distributed to enforce both global and supplemental guidelines.  
* Councils may propose supplemental guidelines tailored to regional requirements.  
* Supplemental guidelines must be ratified by majority community vote before adoption.  
* Forks or derivative works of the platform code are only recognized if approved by a council of at least ten members and ratified by community vote.  
* Clients must refuse to connect to or interoperate with forks that are not ratified under this charter.  
* Councils dissolve automatically if quorum is not met, by majority council vote, or by majority community request.  
* Dissolution triggers new elections; interim caretakers may only perform administrative continuity without policy changes.  
* All governance actions, including votes, dissolutions, blacklists, revocations, and guideline proposals, are logged on-chain with threshold signatures.  
* Transparency is mandatory; all governance records must be auditable by the community.  
* Appeals to council decisions are permitted through new proposals and community votes; original actions remain in force until superseded.  
* Blacklisting and revocation actions must include documented reason codes and threshold signatures.  
* Councils enforce global guidelines defined in the manifesto and supplemental guidelines ratified by the community.  
* Governance legitimacy is enforced at the protocol level; clients validate council composition, quorum, and vote results before accepting governance actions.  
* This charter ensures that forks, governance, and enforcement remain community-driven, transparent, and constitutionally bound.
