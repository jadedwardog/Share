# **README**

This repository contains the decentralized blockchain content platform. It is governed by strict cryptographic enforcement, transparent governance, and community-driven councils. The manifesto defines the principles, and the governance charter enforces legitimacy of forks and derivative works.

* Platform code is licensed under AGPL-3.0 (LICENSE.md).  
* User-generated content is licensed independently (CONTENT\_LICENSE.md).  
* Governance Charter (GOVERNANCE\_CHARTER.md) defines council composition, supplemental guidelines, fork approval rules, dissolution procedures, and blacklisting/revocation processes.  
* Technical Specification (TECHNICAL\_SPEC.md) details account lifecycle, encryption pipeline, client behavior, governance flows, and enforcement, with references to the charter.  
* Manifesto (MANIFESTO.md) outlines the principles of decentralization, cryptographic enforcement, and constitutional governance.  
* Client Implementation Guide (CLIENT\_IMPLEMENTATION\_GUIDE.md) provides instructions for client-side enforcement of governance and bandwidth efficiency.  
* Cryptographic Protocol Specification (CRYPTO\_PROTOCOL\_SPEC.md) defines the primitives, key derivation, envelope formats, and revocation lists.  
* Governance Constitution (GOVERNANCE\_CONSTITUTION.md) formalizes council rules, supplemental guidelines, dissolution, and transparency requirements.  
* Substrate Runtime Outline (SUBSTRATE\_RUNTIME\_OUTLINE.md) describes how governance and enforcement are encoded at the runtime level.  
* User Specification (USER\_SPECIFICATION.md) defines user roles, account creation, recovery key management, content posting, and licensing responsibilities.  
* Payload Specification (PAYLOAD\_SPECIFICATION.md) defines content manifest structure, chunking, encryption, compression, and summary formats.  
* Forks or derivatives are only recognized if approved by a council of at least ten members and ratified by community vote.  
* Clients enforce governance legitimacy by refusing to connect to non-ratified forks.  
* Councils propose supplemental guidelines which must be ratified by community vote before adoption.  
* Councils dissolve automatically if quorum is not met, by majority council vote, or by majority community request, as defined in the charter.  
* All governance actions are logged on-chain with threshold signatures and are auditable.

This README reflects the manifesto, technical specifications, licensing documents, and governance charter, ensuring constitutional governance and licensing separation.
