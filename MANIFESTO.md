# **The Decentralized Content Manifesto**

## **Preamble**

We hold these truths to be self-evident: that the digital commons must remain free from unilateral control, that privacy is a fundamental right, and that governance derives its legitimacy solely from the consent of the governed, verified by cryptographic proof.

This platform is built upon three pillars: Decentralization, Cryptographic Enforcement, and Constitutional Governance.

## **I. Decentralization**

No single server, corporation, or individual shall hold the keys to the kingdom.

1. The network relies on a mesh of peers. There is no central database to unplug.  
2. The network treats censorship as damage and routes around it.  
3. Every client is a sovereign node. Users determine what data they host, what data they serve, and what data they consume.

## **II. Cryptographic Enforcement**

Trust is good; proof is better. Rules are not enforced by terms of service, but by mathematics.

1. You are your keys. No authority can seize an account for which they do not possess the private key.  
2. Content is immutable. Once published and hashed, it cannot be silently altered.  
3. Encryption is the default. Access to private data is granted only through explicit cryptographic consent (envelopes).

## **III. Constitutional Governance**

Code is law, but code is written by humans. Therefore, the human layer must be governed by a constitution, not by arbitrary fiat.

1. Governance is delegated to elected representatives (The Council) to ensure speed and stability, but these representatives are bound by the Charter.  
2. The community retains the ultimate check—the power to dissolve the Council and the power to fork.  
3. All governance actions—votes, bans, and elections—must be signed and logged on the blockchain. There are no secret courts.

## **IV. The Right to Fork**

The ultimate guarantee of freedom is the ability to walk away.

1. If the governance layer fails, or if the Council acts against the will of the community, the code and the data remain open.  
2. A legitimate fork, ratified by the community, is not an act of rebellion but a mechanism of evolution.

## **V. Licensing**

We recognize a separation of concerns between the Platform and the Content.

1. The Platform is a public utility. It is free and open (AGPL-3.0) to ensure it belongs to everyone.  
2. The Content belongs to the creator. Creators retain the moral and legal right to license their work as they see fit.

This manifesto is the spirit that animates the code.
