# **License**

This project uses a dual-license model:

* Platform code is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0).  
* User-generated content is licensed independently under CONTENT\_LICENSE.md.

Additional governance provisions:

* Forks or derivative works are only recognized if approved by a council of at least ten members and ratified by community vote, as defined in GOVERNANCE\_CHARTER.md.  
* Clients enforce governance legitimacy by refusing to connect to non-ratified forks.  
* All governance actions, including fork approvals, are logged on-chain with threshold signatures.

This license structure ensures that the platform code remains open-source and protected, while user content retains independent licensing freedom, and governance legitimacy is constitutionally enforced.
